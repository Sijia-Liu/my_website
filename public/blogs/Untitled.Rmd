## Background
I was honored to participate in 2020 Bain Data Challenge during the week of Oct 19, 2020. This year's data challenge is in cooperation with The Natural Conservancy. Our topic is to use features of Wisconsin's land in 2001, including the elevate, forest area etc. to predict the area of urban land in 2016. 

After a week of exploring, I had a chance to present my insights in front of consultants, data scientists from Bain, as well as experts from The Natural Conservancy. I also met a lot of talented fellow data enthusiasts and had so much fun.

## Final Presentation
